	New workflow
</h2>

<p>
	I've developed a new work flow for building static sites with PHP. It's a little rough around the edges but I like how flexible and simple it is. At least for my understanding of PHP.

	The key to success on this platform is using PHP with wget to grab the rendered site. Check out the documentation for more information.
